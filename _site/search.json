    "text": "FishEye International is a non-profit organisation which focuses on countering illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. They had believed that companies with anomalous structures are far more likely to be involved in IUU. After obtaining access to an international database on fishing related companies including information about companies, owners, workers, and financial status, FishEye is aiming to use this graph to identify anomalies that could indicate a company is involved in IUU.\nA dashboard will be developed to enable interactive web-enabled visualizations and allow users to select and visualize companies through the lens of different dimensions. Users will be able to draw comparisons between companies based on different attributes selected and network size to identify and infer possible involvements in illegal activities.\nThe application is built to integrate techniques from data analytics and data visualizations by using R shiny.\nDatasets are provided from the Vast Challenge 2023 official website in csv format. They contain information on the nodes symbolising each identified companies, information such as products and services offered, revenue and country of registration, as well as the network links to business owners and company contacts.\nThe team will carry out data preparation and processing, as well as feature engineering techniques as follows.\nThe following R packages will be used in the project.\nUse visual analytics to identify anomalies in the business groups present in the knowledge graph.\nIt is pertinent to first understand the characteristics of the companies’ network of and attempt to establish the relationship of the entities (beneficial owners and company contacts) that are linked with the respective companies. This visualization reveals the network graphs on individual linkages between the company and its owner(s), as well as between the company and its contract(s). Another visualization shows the sub networks of the companies with their interaction with the various entities (owners and contacts) within the entire dataset using community grouping, based on the level of connectivity to each company.\nDevelop a visual analytics process to find similar businesses and group them. This analysis should focus on a business’s most important features and present those features clearly to the user. Measure similarity of businesses that you group in the previous question. Express confidence in your groupings visually\nFishEye’s knowledge graph contains a long list of companies encompassing a diverse spectrum of industries. This visualisation will help to identify and group the companies into distinctive business clusters based on the relevance of the companies’ product and service types using suitable key words. Tree maps are presented to provide more details of key companies in the respective business groups from the perspective of revenue amount and country registered.\nIn addition to the above, word clouds will be displayed to provide a sensing on the predominant types of products and services which the companies are involved in. This information will enable the team to potentially narrow down the appropriate business groups for more detailed analysis of possible involvement in illegal fishing activities.\nBased on your visualizations, provide evidence for or against the case that anomalous companies are involved in illegal fishing. Which business groups should FishEye investigate further?\nFollowing the identification of the relevant business group that could potentially be involved in illegal fishing activities, the investigation will focus on the companies within the identified business group. This visualization shows the company network profiles, and the characterisation of the interaction with the respective entities (beneficial owner and company contacts).\nThe visualisation subsequently narrows down to the relevant companies suspected of their involvement in illegal fishing activities. It highlights to the audience on anomalies of the network structures and patterns, in particularly on unusually high inter-connectivity between node entities. Deeper insights on the attributes of companies on suspicion will be revealed.\nThis section discusses the challenges faced in carrying out this project and how they are overcome. Suggestions for future improvements including acquiring additional resources to aid in the project execution and the proposed follow-up activities will also be documented.\nThe dataset based on the knowledge graph presented certain challenges for the analysis,\nThe entire Nodes and Edges record dataset contains only the names of the companies, beneficial owners and company contacts, together with other attributes on company revenue and country the companies are registered. The data does not provide further details on the entity or mode of interactions (e.g. vessel types or ID) or any historical records of illegal activities for reference. Hence, there are no distinctive clues for the team to establish evidence of illegal fishing activities, and that the team could only based on these limited parameters to make possible inference.\nThere were data quality issues, such data inconsistency, and unclean data.\nMore comprehensive analysis could be carried out in future with the following improvements:"

After obtaining access to an international database on fishing related companies including information about companies, owners, workers, and financial status, FishEye is aiming to use this graph to identify anomalies that could indicate a company is involved in IUU.\nFor our project, we aim to achieve the following objectives: (a) Understand patterns of groups in the knowledge graph and highlight anomalous groups, (b) Identify anomalies in the business groups present in the knowledge graph, (c) Develop a visual analytics process to find similar businesses and group them based on important features identified, (d) Measure similarity of the grouped businesses, and (e) Present the case on whether anomalous companies are involved in illegal fishing, and highlight business groups that require further investigations.\nOur tasks are to assist FishEye in developing a new visual analytics approach to better understand fishing business anomalies. By accurately detecting and understanding anomalies, such as illegal or overfishing activities, the visual analytics approach can contribute to more effective fisheries management. This, in turn, promotes sustainable fishing practices, helps preserve marine ecosystems, and ensures the long-term viability of fish populations.\nWe will adopt the following methodology:\nThe following table details the scope of work and responsibilities assigned to the respective members of the Team. The Team has also included a timeline to aid the Project’s internal progress monitoring.\nThe team aims to deliver useful insights on identifying potentially suspicious companies which may be involved in illegal fishing activities through various visualisation methods. This approach can serve as a reference for other projects with similar context of identifying anomalies. This proposal has been drawn up to guide the Team on the implementation approach to realise the project objective. All intermediate tasks will be carried out by the Team with adherence to the project timeline for the eventual submission of the project deliverables."
